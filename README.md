D3 challenge completed for UMN Data Analytics boot camp. All work completed by Zoe Poeschl.

# Data Journalism and D3

## Background

The data set included is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Your Task

You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the `app.js` file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
